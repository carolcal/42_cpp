# 42 C++ Exercises

This repository contains my solutions to the C++ exercise lists from the 42 School curriculum. Each module focuses on a specific aspect of the C++ language, following the official 42 subject descriptions and project structure.

## Exercises

The goal of these exercises is to develop a strong foundation in C++ by solving challenges, each list of exercises brought a new concept for us to study and develop ourselves:
### CPP00 : ✅ 100/100
- **Concepts:** Namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static, const, and some other basic stuff
- **EX00:** First contact with c++ language, learn how to print on the output, use casting and some functions from the stardart library.
- **EX01:** First contact with object orientation, learn how to create and use classes.
- **EX02:** Reconstruct the `Account.cpp` file based on its `.hpp` and the provided tests. This exercise practices many core C++ skills and offers an early introduction to concepts like containers and iterators, which will be used more extensively starting from C++ Module 07.

### CPP01 : ✅ 100/100
- **Concepts:** Memory allocation, pointers to members, references and switch statements.
- **EX00:** The difference between heap and stack memory and how to manage each one.
- **EX01:** Create an array of classes.
- **EX02:** The difference between variable, `*` pointer and `&` reference.
- **EX03:** Use class inside other classes.
- **EX04:** Replicate command line sed.
- **EX05:** Use a pointer-to-member-function array to choose which function is going to use.
- **EX06:** The same as the previous exercise but now using switch to choose which function is going to use.
