# 42 C++ Exercises

This repository contains my solutions to the C++ exercise lists from the 42 School curriculum. Each module focuses on a specific aspect of the C++ language, following the official 42 subject descriptions and project structure.

## Exercises Overview
The goal of these exercises is to build a solid foundation in C++ by solving challenges. Each list introduces new concepts for us to study and master:

### CPP00 : ✅ **100**/<sub>100</sub>
- **Concepts:** Namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static, const, and some other basic stuff
- **00:** First contact with C++ — learn how to print output, use casting, and some functions from the standard library.
- **01:** Introduction to object-oriented programming — creating and using classes.
- **02:** Reconstruct `Account.cpp` based on its header and provided tests; introduces containers and iterators, concepts expanded in later modules.

### CPP01 : ✅ **100**/<sub>100</sub>
- **Concepts:** Memory allocation, pointers to members, references and switch statements.
- **00:** Understanding heap vs. stack memory management.
- **01:** Create an array of classes.
- **02:** Differences between variables, pointers (*), and references (&).
- **03:** Using classes inside other classes.
- **04:** Implementing a command-line `sed` replacement.
- **05:** Using a pointer-to-member-function array to select functions dynamically.
- **06:** Similar to EX05, but using `switch` statements.

### CPP02 : ✅ **100**/<sub>100</sub>
- **Concepts:** Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading and the Orthodox Canonical class form
- **00:** Implementing a class in Orthodox Canonical Form.
- **01:** Creating a fixed-point number class.
- **02:** Overloading operators: comparison (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`), arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), increment/decrement (`++`, `--`), and `min`/`max` functions.
- **03:** BSP function to determine if a point lies inside a triangle.

### CPP03 : ✅ **100**/<sub>100</sub>
- **Concepts:** Inheritance
- **00:** `ClapTrap` class with its own properties, variables and functions.
- **01:** `ScavTrap` class inherits from `ClapTrap` and implements its own functions.
- **02:** `FragTrap` class inherits from `ClapTrap` and also implementing its own functions.
- **03:** `DiamondTrap` class demonstrates diamond inheritance by inheriting from both `ScavTrap` and `FragTrap`.

### CPP04 : ✅ **100**/<sub>100</sub>
- **Concepts:** Subtype Polymorphism, Abstract Classes, and Interfaces.
- **EX00:** Demonstrate polymorphism differences between derived classes with and without virtual functions.
- **EX01:** Practice deep copying, dynamic allocation, and proper destructor behavior in polymorphic hierarchies.
- **EX02:** Abstract class
- **EX03:** Implement interface using the concepts lerned in the previus exercises

### CPP05 : ✅ **100**/<sub>100</sub>
- **Concepts:** Repetition and Exceptions
- **00:** Using exceptions, constant attributes, and operator overloading to manage object state with constraints.
- **01:** Implement class collaboration with access control, validation, and exceptions.
- **02:** Use abstract classes and inheritance for forms with specific actions.
- **03:** Implement a factory method pattern for dynamic form creation based on string identifiers.

### CPP06 : ✅ **100**/<sub>100</sub>
- **Concepts:** C++ casts
- **00:** Conversion between scalar types.
- **01:** Serialization and deserialization.
- **02:** Identify real object types and cast between types.

### CPP07 : ✅ **100**/<sub>100</sub>
- **Concepts:** C++ templates
- **00:** Implement `swap`, `min` and `max` functions.
- **01:** Create a function template that iterates through any array type and applies a function to each element.
- **02:** Implement a generic, bounds-checked, dynamically allocated array class with proper copy semantics and exception safety.

### CPP08 : ✅ **100**/<sub>100</sub>
- **Concepts:** Templated containers, iterators, algorithms
- **00:** Function template to search for an integer in any integer container.
- **01:** Fixed-capacity integer container class that computing shortest and longest spans between stored numbers.
- **02:** Create a MutantStack class inheriting from std::stack and adds iterator functions.

### CPP09 : ✅ **100**/<sub>100</sub>
- **Concepts:** STL
- **00:** A program that reads from a CSV database and an input file of dates with amounts, then outputs the corresponding values for those dates.
- **01:** A program that calculates from a single inverted Polish notation expression.
- **02:** Implement the Ford-Johnson (merge-insert) sorting algorithm using at least two STL containers.
